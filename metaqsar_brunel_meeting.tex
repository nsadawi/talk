\section{Another Project Underway: Transfer Learning}
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Transfer Learning} 
\begin{itemize}%[<+->]
 \item Transfer learning deals with the ability of a system to recognize and apply knowledge and skills learned in previous tasks to novel tasks
 \item It aims to extract the knowledge from one or more source tasks (data with known classes) and applies the knowledge to a target task (data with unknown classes)
 \item Traditional machine learning techniques try to learn each task from scratch, while transfer learning techniques try to transfer the knowledge from some previous tasks to a target task when the latter has fewer high-quality training data
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Inductive Transfer Learning} 
\begin{itemize}%[<+->]
 \item \textbf{Instance-transfer:} To re-weight some labeled data in a source domain for use in the target domain %(I think this is suitable for our purposes - Noureddin)
 \item \textbf{Feature-representation-transfer:} Find a good feature representation that reduces difference between a source and a target domain or minimizes error of models
 \item \textbf{Model-transfer:} Discover shared parameters or priors of models between a source domain and a target domain
 \item \textbf{Relational-knowledge-transfer:} Build mapping of relational knowledge between a source domain and a target domain
 \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Instance-Transfer Learning} 
\begin{itemize}%[<+->]
 \item The instance-transfer approach to the inductive transfer learning setting is intuitively appealing
 \item \textbf{Assumption:} the source domain and target domain data use exactly the same features and labels
 \item \textbf{Motivation:} Although the source domain data can not be reused directly, there are some parts of the data that can still be reused by re-weighting
 \item \textbf{Main Idea:} Discriminatively adjust weights of data in the source domain for use in the target domain 
 \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Targets and their Sequences} 
\begin{itemize}%[<+->]
 \item Currently we are working on data for three organisms:
 \begin{itemize}%[<+->]
   \item Homo Sapiens
   \item Plasmodium Falciparum (parasite)
   \item Plasmodium Vivax (parasite)
 \end{itemize}
  
  \item The data is from assays carried out by Eve Robot Scientist

 \item We use sequences to check how similar these targets are (the UniProt database)
 \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{UniProt} 
\begin{itemize}%[<+->]
 \item UniProt (www.uniprot.org) is a manually curated database which focuses on protein sequences
 \item Curators at UniProt pay much attention to the amount and quality of information about proteins
 \item Each protein has a UniProt entry
 \item Other major databases (e.g. NCBI, ChEMBL, DrugBank) link to it
 
 \end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Retrieving a UniProt Protein Sequence} 
\begin{itemize}%[<+->]
 \item Searching for the full protein name + the organism name, i.e. dihydrofolate reductase organism: "homo sapiens"
 \item This will return several entries
 \item Some entries have different colours and they are \textbf{reviewed}
 
 \end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Our Idea} 
\begin{itemize}%[<+->]
 \item What we would like to test is whether we can transfer what we learn about one parasite to another parasite
 \item We can measure the distance (or similarity) between parasites using their sequences 
 \item Our current assumption is that the more different (or more far apart) the parasites the more difficult (or less accurate) transfer learning becomes
 
%What we transfer is the difference in activity between human and parasites. In more detail, we transfer the difference in activity between a human (where drug is inactive) and one parasite (where drug is active) to another parasite (about which we have little data)
 \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{comment}

\frametitle{Comparing Two Sequences Graphically} 
\begin{itemize}%[<+->]
 \item here have the four figures for comparison
 
%What we transfer is the difference in activity between human and parasites. In more detail, we transfer the difference in activity between a human (where drug is inactive) and one parasite (where drug is active) to another parasite (about which we have little data)

 \item \textbf{Local Sequence Alignment:} an alignment of part of one sequence to part of another sequence\\
   \textit{we compute Smith-Waterman local alignment}
